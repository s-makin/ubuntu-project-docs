# Change phasing on delivering SRU updates

```{note}
This page more rightly belongs in "Override Phasing" in the SRU documentation
Just before the "adding members to the team section", but this does not exist here yet.

will eventually be moved to:
* Maintainers -> SRU tasks
```

The delivery of an SRU is phased to allow detecting and holding back the
delivery of regressions that have made it to the `-updates` pocket in spite of
verification in `-proposed` prior to release to `-updates`.

The question of
[why we do phasing](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/explanation/standard-processes/#explanation-phasing),
how to
[check the current state](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/howto/phasing/#investigate-halted-phased-update),
and much more, is well explained in
[the SRU docs](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/).

However, there also is a way to
[override auto-halting the phasing](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/internal/#internal-override-phasing),
which can be performed by Archive Admins **or** SRU team members.

This is needed when a package is *detected* as either crashing more frequently
or has a new crash, but when this is actually a false positive.

## Types of triggers

Phasing stops can be triggered in two ways: **automated** and **manual**.

* **Automated phasing stops** are triggered by `errors.ubuntu.com`. If it
  detects a spike of crash reports with a new version, or an altogether new
  crash with the new package version, phasing is auto-halted. The tooling sets
  the phasing to zero, which can be seen in
  [phased updates](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/phased-updates.html),
  and notifies the sponsor of the upload.

* **Manual phasing stops** are due to humans; usually either the developer that
  tracks their upload, or a severe and urgent case of a `regression-update` bug.
  In this case an SRU team member or Archive Admin sets the phasing to zero, to
  stop delivering the potentially bad update.

## Options for the Archive Admin

In both cases the phasing stop now needs to be investigated urgently to come to
a conclusion, choosing between one of the following paths:

1. **replace/remove:**

   If a fix is needed, the improved new version is likely not immediately ready
   and verified enough to be pushed to `-updates` (superseding the former). In
   that case the bad version should be
   {ref}`removed from -updates and the former version restored <revert-a-package-to-a-previous-version>`.

1. **continue phasing**:

   If instead it turns out to be a false alarm, phasing can be continued.


## Change override

Once certain that it is the right step, phasing can be changed via
`change-override`. The relevant arguments are similar to other actions with
`change-override`. In addition, use `--percentage` to set the new phasing ratio.

We only deliver (and thereby phase) binaries, but we usually want to set this
consistently for all binaries at once for a given source package, so we'd
usually use `--source-and-binary`.

For example, to hold the phasing of `containerd-app` in `noble-updates` and set
it back to zero (to no longer provide this update), run:

```none
./change-override --percentage 0 --suite noble-updates --source-and-binary containerd-app
```
