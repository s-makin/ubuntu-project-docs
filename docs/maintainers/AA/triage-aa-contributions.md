# Check contributions to AA process and documentation

Everyone is encouraged in {ref}`contribute` to help with the documentation
and modernizing the processes in this repository.

To keep that maintainable for sub-teams the Ubuntu project documentation uses
labels to separate issues and contributions related to particular sub-teams.

Triage is done by the Authors for now, but eventually shall be automated
based on which directory content is in.

To process that influx the Archive Admin team shall semi regularly check
[issues/discussions](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22AA%22)
and [pull requests](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AAA)
labeled for the AA team's consideration.
